#  TASK 2-Store the sum of two numbers a and b in a variable result

# a = 2
# b = 3
# result = a + b
# # print(result)

#TASK 10- Use a while loop to count from 1 to 5 and print all of the numbers in the terminal.

# num = 0

# while num < 5:
#     num = num + 1
#     print(num)

# TASK 6-Given two boolean values a and b, store the result of a or b in result.

# a = False
# b = True

# result = a + b

# print(result )


# TASK 12-Use a for loop with range() to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 and store it in result.
# total=0
# for i in range(0, 12, 2):
#     total+=i
# print(total)
